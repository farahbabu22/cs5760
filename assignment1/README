# Assignment 1: System call and library function

This is the assignment to get familiar with the development environment located in UMSL. The execirse implemented illustrates the usage of program which behaves similar to the env unix utility. 


# Files

1. doenv.c contains the code of the project
2. Makefile
3. README

## Running the program

%    make

## Remove all executables after run
%  make clean

## System calls, library functions and external variables used
1. getenv
2. getopt
3. putenv
4. clearenv
5. strchr
6. environ
7. perr
8. malloc
9. strcat
10. system

## Example Runs

    % ./doenv -i [name=value] [name=value]
Replaces the current execution environment and prints the new replaced values

    % ./doenv -i [name=value] [command1]
Replaces the current execution environment and executes the command1

    % ./doenv [name=value]

Appends the name value if it doesn't exists if exists replaces the value(updates) and prints the new environment values

    % ./doenv [name=value] [command1]

Appends the name value if it doesn't exists, if exists replaces the value(update) and executes the command.


## Items to be improved on
1.   Need to handle options for the command1
2.  Need to handle error better
